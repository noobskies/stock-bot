## Next Steps

### Phase 8: Web Dashboard (Ready to Begin)

**Bot is now functional - proceed with dashboard implementation:**

1. **Flask Application Structure**

   - Create src/dashboard/app.py with Flask initialization
   - Set up routes module for API endpoints
   - Configure static file serving (CSS/JS)
   - Set up template rendering

2. **API Routes Implementation**

   - GET /api/portfolio - Portfolio state and metrics
   - GET /api/signals - Pending signals for approval
   - POST /api/signals/<id>/approve - Approve signal
   - POST /api/signals/<id>/reject - Reject signal
   - POST /api/bot/start - Start bot
   - POST /api/bot/stop - Stop bot
   - GET/POST /api/settings - Configuration management

3. **HTML Templates**

   - templates/base.html - Base layout with navigation
   - templates/index.html - Dashboard home (portfolio overview)
   - templates/trades.html - Trade history and analytics
   - templates/signals.html - Signal management
   - templates/settings.html - Configuration

4. **Static Assets**

   - static/css/style.css - Dashboard styling
   - static/js/dashboard.js - Real-time updates and interactions

5. **Testing & Integration**
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Verify signal approval workflow
   - Test bot control (start/stop)
   - Verify real-time data updates

## Active Decisions

### Trading Strategy Decisions

1. **Start with PLTR Only**

   - Reasoning: Simpler to debug, faster iteration
   - Expansion Plan: Add 2-3 tech stocks after 1 month
   - Risk: Less diversification (mitigated by position limits)

2. **Default to Hybrid Mode**

   - Auto-execute signals with confidence >80%
   - Manual approval for confidence 70-80%
   - Reject signals with confidence <70%

3. **Close Positions Daily (Initially)**

   - Eliminates gap risk
   - Simplifies position tracking
   - Can enable overnight holding later

4. **Paper Trading Mandatory**
   - Minimum 2 weeks before live consideration
   - Goal: Prove stability and risk management
   - Metric: >99% uptime, zero rule violations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Use SQLite (Not PostgreSQL)**

   - Sufficient for single user
   - Zero maintenance overhead
   - Can migrate later if needed

2. **Flask Dashboard (Not React)**

   - Faster development for solo project
   - Server-side rendering simpler
   - Can add WebSocket updates later

3. **LSTM + Ensemble Approach**

   - Primary: LSTM for time series patterns
   - Secondary: Random Forest for confirmation
   - Tertiary: Simple momentum indicators
   - Confidence = weighted average of all three

4. **No GPU Required**
   - CPU training sufficient (10-30 min)
   - Keeps system requirements low
   - GPU support can be added later

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Documentation Tools

**Context7 MCP Server**: Integrated for real-time library documentation access

- **Availability**: Accessible via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Primary Use**: Fetch up-to-date documentation for Python libraries
- **Key Libraries**: TensorFlow (latest), pandas (latest), alpaca-trade-api (latest), scikit-learn (latest), Flask (latest), SQLAlchemy (latest), loguru (latest)
- **When to Use**: Before implementing with unfamiliar APIs, verifying parameter types, checking for deprecations, reviewing best practices

**Workflow**: Identify library → Resolve library ID → Fetch docs → Implement with verified patterns

### Code Organization

**Module Structure**:

- Each module has clear responsibility
- No circular dependencies
- All imports at module level
- Type hints everywhere (Python 3.10+)

**Naming Conventions**:

- Files: lowercase_with_underscores.py
- Classes: PascalCase
- Functions: snake_case
- Constants: UPPER_CASE
- Private: \_leading_underscore

**Error Handling**:

- Never fail silently
- All external calls wrapped in try/except
- Log errors with context
- Graceful degradation where possible

### Testing Approach

**Test Coverage Goals**:

- Unit tests: >80% coverage
- Integration tests: All API interactions
- Backtesting: 2+ years historical data
- Paper trading: 2+ weeks live simulation

**Test Organization**:

- Mirror src/ structure in tests/
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Mock external APIs (Alpaca, Yahoo Finance)
- Separate test database

### Development Workflow

**Git Workflow**:

- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep commits focused (one logical change)
- Push to remote after each session

**Documentation Requirements**:

- Update Memory Bank when architecture changes
- Document all non-obvious decisions
- Keep README.md current
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Insights from Planning Phase

1. **Risk Management is Critical**

   - Position sizing must be calculated precisely
   - Stop losses must execute without hesitation
   - Daily loss limits prevent catastrophic losses
   - Risk validation must happen BEFORE every trade

2. **ML Confidence is Key**

   - Not all predictions are equal
   - Confidence threshold determines execution mode
   - Ensemble approach reduces false positives
   - Historical accuracy informs confidence calibration

3. **User Trust is Essential**

   - Transparency in every decision
   - Manual override always available
   - Complete audit trail
   - Clear explanations for rejections

4. **Simplicity Over Features**

   - Start with one stock (PLTR)
   - Paper trading first (mandatory)
   - Simple indicators initially
   - Add complexity only when needed

5. **Technical Debt Management**
   - Use TODO comments for future improvements
   - Document known limitations
   - Plan for migration paths (SQLite → PostgreSQL)
   - Keep refactoring in mind

### Anticipated Challenges

1. **Model Accuracy**: May need iteration to reach >60% accuracy

   - Solution: Extensive backtesting, feature engineering
   - Fallback: Lower confidence threshold for manual mode

2. **API Reliability**: Alpaca or network issues could disrupt trading

   - Solution: Retry logic, caching, graceful degradation
   - Monitoring: Alert on repeated failures

3. **Execution Speed**: Orders must execute within 1 second

   - Solution: Optimize code path, parallel processing
   - Testing: Measure latency in paper trading

4. **Data Quality**: Missing or incorrect data could cause bad predictions

   - Solution: Validation at every step, fallback data sources
   - Monitoring: Log all data anomalies

5. **User Experience**: Dashboard must be intuitive and responsive
   - Solution: User testing (self), iterative refinement
   - Benchmark: <2 second load time

### Design Philosophy

**Fail-Safe Principles**:

- Fail loudly, not silently
- When in doubt, don't trade
- Risk limits are hard constraints
- Manual override always available
- Paper trading proves reliability

**Iterative Development**:

- Build minimum viable version first
- Test thoroughly at each phase
- Add features incrementally
- Refactor as understanding improves

**Documentation First**:

- Memory Bank guides all development
- Update docs when decisions change
- Future Cline relies entirely on documentation
- No tribal knowledge

## Current Blockers

**None** - All critical blockers resolved ✅

### Previously Resolved

**Ensemble Prediction Bug** ✅ RESOLVED (Session 6 - November 13, 2025)

- **Issue**: Test 8 failed initially with TypeError about 'probability' field
- **Root Cause**: Python import cache from old code version
- **Impact**: Blocked Test 8 ensemble prediction generation
- **Solution**: Cleared Python cache with `find . -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {}`
- **Verification**: Test 8 re-run passed all 6/6 validation checks
- **Finding**: Code was already correct in ensemble.py (lines 185-205)
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Ensemble prediction system operational

**Alpaca API Import Incompatibility** ✅ RESOLVED (Session 3 - November 13, 2025)

- **Issue**: Code written for `alpaca-py` SDK, but `alpaca-trade-api` SDK installed
- **Impact**: Bot could not run - ImportError on startup
- **Solution**: Switched to `alpaca-py` SDK (cleaner approach)
  - Updated requirements.txt: `alpaca-py>=0.30.1`
  - Reinstalled dependencies: alpaca-py 0.43.2 installed
  - Fixed 3 class name references in main.py
- **Verification**: All imports working, TradingBot successfully initializes
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Bot is now functional

## Open Questions

### Technical Questions

1. **Should we use WebSocket for real-time dashboard updates?**

   - Current: HTTP polling every 30 seconds
   - Alternative: WebSocket for push updates
   - Decision: Start with polling, add WebSocket if needed

2. **Should we implement caching for API responses?**

   - Alternative: Redis/in-memory cache
   - Decision: Add caching if API limits become issue

3. **Should we use Docker for deployment?**
   - Current: Run directly on local machine
   - Alternative: Docker container
   - Decision: Add Docker later for easier deployment

### Strategy Questions

1. **What indicators should we start with?**

   - Decided: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, SMA/EMA, Volume
   - Open: Should we add more or start minimal?

2. **Should we implement pre-market data collection?**

   - Current: Start collecting at 9:30 AM
   - Alternative: Collect from 4:00 AM for better preparation
   - Decision: TBD based on performance

3. **Should we add news sentiment analysis?**
   - Current: Technical indicators only
   - Alternative: Include news/social sentiment
   - Decision: Phase 2 enhancement (not initial scope)
